//! Dynamically-scoped variables.
//!
//! _Dynamic_ or _fluid_ variables are a handy way to define global configuration values.
//! They come from the Lisp family of languages where they are relatively popular in this role.
//!
//! # Declaring dynamic variables
//!
//! [`fluid_let!`] macro is used to declare dynamic variables. Dynamic variables
//! are _global_, therefore they must be declared as `static`:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! use fluid_let::fluid_let;
//!
//! fluid_let!(static LOG_FILE: File);
//! ```
//!
//! The actual type of `LOG_FILE` variable will be `Option<&File>`: that is,
//! possibly absent reference to a file. All dynamic variables have `None` as
//! their default value, unless a particular value is set for them.
//!
//! [`fluid_let!`]: macro.fluid_let.html
//!
//! # Setting dynamic variables
//!
//! [`set`] is used to give value to a dynamic variable:
//!
//! [`set`]: struct.DynamicVariable.html#method.set
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::fs::File;
//! #
//! # use fluid_let::fluid_let;
//! #
//! # fluid_let!(static LOG_FILE: File);
//! #
//! # fn open(path: &str) -> File { unimplemented!() }
//! #
//! let log_file: File = open("/tmp/log.txt");
//!
//! LOG_FILE.set(&log_file, || {
//!     //
//!     // logs will be redirected to /tmp/log.txt in this block
//!     //
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Note that you store an _immutable reference_ in the dynamic variable.
//! You canâ€™t directly modify the dynamic variable value after setting it,
//! but you can use something like `Cell` or `RefCell` to circumvent that.
//!
//! The new value is in effect within the _dynamic extent_ of the assignment, that is within
//! the closure passed to `set`. Once the closure returns, the previous value of the variable
//! is restored. You can nest assignments arbitrarily:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::fs::File;
//! #
//! # use fluid_let::fluid_let;
//! #
//! # fluid_let!(static LOG_FILE: File);
//! #
//! # fn open(path: &str) -> File { unimplemented!() }
//! #
//! LOG_FILE.set(&open("/tmp/log.txt"), || {
//!     //
//!     // log to /tmp/log.txt here
//!     //
//!     LOG_FILE.set(&open("/dev/null"), || {
//!         //
//!         // log to /dev/null for a bit
//!         //
//!     });
//!     //
//!     // log to /tmp/log.txt again
//!     //
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! # Accessing dynamic variables
//!
//! [`get`] is used to retrieve the current value of a dynamic variable:
//!
//! [`get`]: struct.DynamicVariable.html#method.get
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::io::{self, Write};
//! # use std::fs::File;
//! #
//! # use fluid_let::fluid_let;
//! #
//! # fluid_let!(static LOG_FILE: File);
//! #
//! fn write_log(msg: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
//!     LOG_FILE.get(|current| {
//!         if let Some(mut log_file) = current {
//!             write!(log_file, "{}\n", msg)?;
//!         }
//!         Ok(())
//!     })
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Current value of the dynamic variable is passed to the provided closure, and
//! the value returned by the closure becomes the value of the `get()` call.
//!
//! This somewhat weird access interface is dictated by safety requirements. The
//! dynamic variable itself is global and thus has `'static` lifetime. However,
//! its values usually have shorter lifetimes, as short as the corresponing
//! `set()` call. Therefore, access reference must have _even shorter_ lifetime.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! Dynamic variables are global and _thread-local_. That is, each thread gets its own independent
//! instance of a dynamic variable. Values set in one thread are visible only in this thread.
//! Other threads will not see any changes in values of their dynamic variables and may have
//! completely different configurations.
//!
//! Note, however, that this does not free you from the usual synchronization concerns when shared
//! objects are involved. Dynamic variables hold _references_ to objects. Therefore is is entirely
//! possible to bind _the same_ object to a dynamic variable and access it from multiple threads.
//! In this case you will probably need some synchronization to use the shared object in a safe
//! manner, just like you would do when using `Arc` or something.
